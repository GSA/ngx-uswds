# NgxUSWDS
This project takes components in uswds and implements them through angular.  
Original USWDS components can be found here - https://designsystem.digital.gov/components  
Current progress / documentation of this project can be found here - https://gsa.github.io/ngx-uswds   

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm run develop` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Storybook
Run `npm run start` to start storybook documentation in a dev server at port 4200. Run `npm run build-storybook` to build storybook documentation for
production. Alternatively, run `npm run ghpages` to automatically build storybook documentation and deploy to github pages.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
