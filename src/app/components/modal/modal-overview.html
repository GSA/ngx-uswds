<h3>General Accessibility</h3>
<p>
  The modal is dynamically opened outside the normal tab flow of the page and traps focus within the modal when opened.
</p>
<p>
  The other elements within the page body have <code>aria-hidden</code> set to true when a modal is opened
</p>
<p>
  Users may pass in <code>aria-labelledby</code> or <code>aria-describedby</code> attribute values through model
  config when opening the modal
</p>
<p>
  The modal will return focus to opener element if the opener was in focus for all browsers. However, that behaviour
  is inconsistent across browsers if the modal was opened through a click and the opener button was not in focus on click
</p>
<p>
  Through keyboard, pressing the <code>Esc</code> button will also close the modal (This behavior can be toggled off if needed)
</p>
