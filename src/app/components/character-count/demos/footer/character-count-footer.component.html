<p>
  The character count message is placed inside an <code>aria-live</code> region using <code>aria-live="polite"</code> so that
  screenreaders can announce character limitation changes as user types
</p>

<p>
  The character count directive also accepts an <code>id</code> value through <code>messageId</code> input (auto-generated if not provided).
  This way users can use <code>aria-describedby</code> on their input to associate the character counter with the input
